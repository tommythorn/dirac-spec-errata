%Seven different variable-length code formats are used. Of these three,
%the unary binarisation formats are not used directly for data encoding
%but for binarising values so that integer values may be produced from
%strings of bits and vice-versa. Binarisation is used in the context of
%arithmetic decoding. [Change this]

Variable-length codes are used in two ways in the Dirac stream. The first
use is for direct encoding into the stream. The second use is for binarisation
in the arithmetic encoding/decoding process so that integer values may be 
coded and decoded using a binary arithmetic coding engine.
