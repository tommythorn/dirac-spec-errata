If a structure is byte aligned the first bit of the structure coincides
with the first bit of the next byte in the bytestream.

If a structure is byte aligned the previous structure may need to be
padded with up to 7 bits. These seven padding bits are undefined.
Decoding the bytestream does not depend on the value of these undefined
bits.
