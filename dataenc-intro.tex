Data is encoded in the Dirac bitstream in three basic ways: fixed-length
bit-wise and byte-wise encodings; variable-length codes; and arithmetic encoding.

This section defines how data bits are to be extracted from the bitstream and how
sequences of bits are to be interpreted as values of various types using fundamental
data-reading functions, covering encodings of the first two sorts. The extraction
of arithmetic-encoded data is defined in Section \ref{arithdecoding}.
