The Intra fields are not predicted using motion compensation.

This leaves us with a potential problem. The wavelet transform process
assumes that we have a signal which tends to a zero average.

The Intra field is processed to give it a zero mean by removing the DC
component (average value) of each block from the signal. The DC
components are signalled separately. In effect the DC components are a
local spatial prediction, rather than a temporal prediction as applied
in motion compensation.
