The bytestream implements a policy for default parameters designed to
simplify the use of Dirac and enable easy parsing of the bytestream.

All Sequence Parameters and Source Parameters and some decoding
parameters have default values. The default values are determined by the
Video Format. The default values are used unless an appropriate flag is
set to explicitly signal otherwise. Typically this means that few
parameters have to be signalled in the bytestream and a user does not
have to understand all the parameter to be able to use the codec.

Sequence and source parameters remain constant throughout the entire
sequence.

The default decoding parameters, corresponding to the chosen Video
Format, are loaded at the beginning of each Picture. Therefore any
changes to the default parameters only affect the current picture. This
supports random access to individual pictures, using the Parse Unit
Offsets, without having to parse any header information.
