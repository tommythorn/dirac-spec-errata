For the purpose of local Motion Compensation, the whole image is divided
up into a number of overlapping blocks that covers the entire image.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \subfigure[A block]{
        \label{fig:}
        \includegraphics[width=1in]{figs/block}
    }
    \hspace{0.5in}
    \subfigure[Positioning of blocks in a frame]{
        \label{fig:}
        \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{figs/block-offset}
   }
   \caption{block \ldots}
   \label{fig:blocks}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:blocks} shows a block and how they overlap at the
pictures left and top edges.

For frames that have their chroma components downsampled, the block
sizes are reduced by the same factor.
