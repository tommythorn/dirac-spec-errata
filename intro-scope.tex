This document specifies normative decoder operations and stream syntax.A 
number of other elements are also included for informative purposes, covering:

\begin{itemize}
    \item encoder operations
    \item encoder and decoder design and implementation issues, including error
recovery
	\item high-level design characteristics and operation
	\item potential application scenarios 
\end{itemize}

In particular we are well aware that many users of this document may wish
to make both encoders and decoders. There are many sources of information
on how to design efficient compression algorithms, for example for entropy coding,
motion estimation, frame-dropping, rate control, motion estimation and 
rate-distortion optimisation. This document does not attempt to address these
issues in detail, but to provide supplementary information
to allow those reasonably "skilled in the art" to develop a Dirac encoder
rapidly and accurately, and approach design compromises knowledgably.
