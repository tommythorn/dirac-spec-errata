Although we said that it is of no practical value to specify a motion
vector for each pixel, there are exceptions.

Some types of motion are more likely to be features of the camera than
the scene. For example, a camera may pan, tilt, rotate, zoom, sheer, or
change of perspective through, say tracking.

If the coder can identify such motion, then Dirac permits the motion to
be signalled by a small set of parameters, which in effect assign a
motion vector to each pixel.
