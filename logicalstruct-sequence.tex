A consecutive list of frames that all share the exact same sequence and
display parameters is a sequence.  Otherwise put, the sequence and
display parameters must not change during a sequence.  A sequence may be
terminated by an end of sequence notification.

The frames within a sequence are numbered consecutively in display
order.
