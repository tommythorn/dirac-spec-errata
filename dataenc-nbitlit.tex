An $n$-bit number in literal format shall be decoded by extracting $n$ bits
in order, using the $read\_bit()$ function (Section \ref{bitpacking})
 and placing the first bit in the leftmost position, the second
bit in the next position and so on. The resulting value is to be
interpreted according to the conventions of the type to which it is
deemed to belong. For example, signed integers are represented in
two's complement format [ISO ref].
