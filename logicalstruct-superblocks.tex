To allow a more efficient representation of blocks and Motion Vectors,
and to allow further explotation of the spatial redundancy in motion
vectors and additionally allow a tradeoff between Motion Vector accuracy
to bytestream symbols required, blocks are transmitted in a 4 by 4
arrangement called a Superblock (figure~\ref{fig:superblock-pu-16of1x1}).

\end{figure}

Blocks can be merged inside the superblock into arrangements of 4 of 2 by 2
blocks, or 1 of 4 by 4 blocks (figures~\ref{fig:superblock-pu-4of2x2} and
\ref{fig:superblock-pu-1of4x4} respectively).  In each
case, only one motion vector is transmitted per merged set of blocks
(also known as a prediction unit).

Each prediction unit has a prediction mode associated with it, which may
be one of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Intra -- for blocks with no Motion Vector associated with
        them.
    \item Ref1Only -- the Motion Vector applies to the first reference frame
        only.
    \item Ref2Only -- the Motion Vector applies to the second reference
        frame only.
    \item Ref1and2 -- two Motion Vectors are sent, each using one
        reference frame.
\end{itemize}

Global motion compensation is opted in/out of at the Superblock level.
If opted in, all prediction units within the super block will be
globally motion compensated, unless they signal that a particular
prediction unit should be intra coded instead.
