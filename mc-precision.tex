The encoder is required to ensure that all calculations are performed by
a decoder within the bounds set by the current level in force.

Typical values for $\psi$ and $\mu$ in the global motion calculations
may be quite large.  Typically the perspective exponent ($\psi$) may be
of the order $2\lg(\picWidth) + \lambda$ bits; the zoom-rotation-shear
exponent ($\mu$) would similary be of the order $\lg(\picHeight) +
\lambda$ bits.
