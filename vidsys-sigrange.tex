The offset and excursion values should be used to convert the
integer-valued decoded luma and chroma data Y, Cb, Cr to intermediate
values EY, ECr, and ECb by the recipe



EY, is normally clipped to the range [0,1], and ECr, and ECb to the
range [-0.5,0.5]. This effectively clips Y to 

[LUMA\_OFFSET, LUMA\_OFFSET+LUMA\_EXCURSION]

and Cb, Cr to

[CHROMA\_OFFSET-LUMA\_EXCURSION/2, LUMA\_OFFSET+LUMA\_EXCURSION/2]

However, maintaining an extended RGB gamut may mean that either such
clipping is not done, or non-standard offset and excursion values are
used to extract the extended gamut from the non-negative decoded Y, Cr,
and Cb values.

Non-default offset and excursion values cannot be coded if the chroma
format is YCgCo: default parameters should be used. However, even in
this case, EY, ECg, and ECo should not be calculated. Instead, direct
integer conversion to RGB should be done as described in Section . (In
fact, excursion values will be ignored in this integer conversion.)
