The colour primaries allow device dependent linear RGB colour
co-ordinates to be mapped to device independent linear CIE XYZ space.
The primaries specified below are the CIE (1931) XYZ chromaticity
co-ordinates of the primaries and the white point of the device. The
maths required to convert between RGB and XYZ is reproduced below.



The colour primary specification therefore allows exact colour
reproduction of decoded RGB values on different displays with different
display primaries. It has to be said that often conversion between
encoded primaries and display primaries is not done.
