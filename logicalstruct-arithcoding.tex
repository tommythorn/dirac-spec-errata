All the data for Motion Vectors and the transformed residuals are
transmitted after having been arithmetically coded.

The arithmetic coder is a black box device that is given an array of
data to code. It codes each symbol in context.

Arithmetic coding achieves good compression through maintaining accurate
counts of the symbol probabilities.  Each set of symbol probabilities is
held in a context (in effect recognising which other data in the array
may be a good match to the symbol to be coded).

Different contexts are used depending upon where the symbol originated
or depending upon some aprori information about the symbol.
