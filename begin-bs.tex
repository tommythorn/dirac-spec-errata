The bytestream of Dirac is the complete, compressed video stream, ready
for file storage or transmission.

The features are

\begin{itemize}
    \item A parse structure which gives ready access to the video, even
    in mid file. This identifies all the static features of the stream.
    Intelligent systems can use the redundancy in this structure to
    recover from errors in the stream.

    \item Blocks of data comprising the arithmetically-coded motion
    vector information

    \item Blocks of data comprising the arithmetically-coded wavelet
    coefficients
\end{itemize}

Because of the arithmetic coding, it is difficult to provide a simple
specification which gives meaningful details of the bytestream without
some reference to either the early coding processes, or the later
decoding process. The simple description of the bytestream would only
refer to compressed motion vectors, and compressed wavelet coefficients.
We have therefore had to provide extra information to explain how to
unpack this data, and how to use the resulting structured data.
