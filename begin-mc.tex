The object of motion compensation is to try to predict the picture in
one image from others in the sequence. In television, the picture
usually contains moving objects, so a key part of the process is to
identify the moving objects and their the details of the motion.

In Dirac, the motion vector is merely an indication of which pixel in
the reference picture can be used as a good prediction for a particular
pixel in the current picture.
