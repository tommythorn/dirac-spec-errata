This section defines the decoding process iwt\_pad\_removal().

When carrying out the forward transform in the coder, it is desirable
that the data is in blocks which permit the iterative subsampling which
is required as part of the lifting process. For some pictures, the
natural size of the image may not give rise to an appropriate set of
values, so padding is inserted. The padding has no useful data and so
should be discarded.

This process is invoked after iwt\_synthesis(). In this process values
not used subsequently are discarded.

Values WIDTH and HEIGHT are defined as follows. For Intra frame
components, if the component is the luma component, the values are set
as

WIDTH = LUMA\_WIDTH

HEIGHT = LUMA\_HEIGHT

If the component is a chroma component, then

WIDTH = CHROMA\_WIDTH

HEIGHT = CHROMA\_HEIGHT

For Inter frame component data, the values are set as follows. For luma
components,

WIDTH = MC\_LUMA\_WIDTH

HEIGHT = MC\_LUMA\_HEIGHT

If the component is a chroma component, then

WIDTH = MC\_CHROMA\_WIDTH

HEIGHT = MC\_CHROMA\_HEIGHT

All component data with horizontal index greater than or equal to WIDTH
or with vertical index greater than or equal to HEIGHT is discarded
(Figure ??).
