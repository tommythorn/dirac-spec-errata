For each block, a vector is provided that gives the relative position of
a block of equal dimension in a reference frame.  This referenced block
is weighted according to a global weight for that frame and weighted
again using a weighting matrix designed to make blocks overlap nicely
and reduce high reduce high frequency components entering the residual
at block edges.

Dirac allows Motion Vectors to be specified to subpixel precision.  When
using a Motion Vector to subpixel precision, the reference image is
upconverted over the referenced area and a sampled upconverted reference
is used.

The maximum motionvector precision is an eighth of a pixel.

Motion Vectors are predicted
