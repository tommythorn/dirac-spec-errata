Access units group frames together. The existance of multiple Access
Units in a sequence allows the sequence to be randomly accessed to the
granularity of an Access Unit.

Access Units commence with an Access Unit Header, containing parameters
that stay in effect for the whole Access Unit (ie, until the next Access
Unit starts).

Access units are unbounded in length.  The end of an Access Unit is
signalled by the start of another.

Access units are logical constructs.  Only an Access Unit Header is
transmitted at the start of the access unit in the bitstream.

Access unit headers contain three categories of information:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Parse parameters -- provide the decoder with information
        required to parse all subsequent data.

    \item Sequence parameters -- provide the video parameters for
        correct decoding.

    \item Display parameters -- provide metadata about the video that is
        not required in the decode process, but may be required by a
        display divice to present the video correctly.
\end{itemize}

The first frame in an Access Unit must be an Intra coded frame.
