Dirac was developed to address the growing complexity and cost of current video
compression standards, which provide greater compression efficiency
at the expense of implementing a very large number of tools. Dirac is
a powerful and flexible compression system, yet uses only a small number
of core tools. A key element of its flexibility is its use of the wavelet
multi-resolution transform for compressing pictures and motion-compensated 
residuals, which allows Dirac to be used across a very wide range of resolutions
without defining additional profiles.
