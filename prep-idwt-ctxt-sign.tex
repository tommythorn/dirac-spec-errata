This section specifies the procedure for choosing contexts for decoding
the sign of a coefficient in position (x,y) in the subband. 

Sign contexts are selected based on the sign of previously decoded
coefficients. The choice of the coefficients used for the decision
depends on the orientation of the subband.

A value PREVIOUS\_VALUE is defined to be

    SUBBAND[y][x-1] if x>0 and the subband is horizontally oriented

    SUBBAND[y-1][x] if y>0 and the subband is vertically oriented

    0 otherwise

The sign context used is specified by .
