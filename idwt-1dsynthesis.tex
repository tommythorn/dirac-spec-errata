This section specifies the one-dimensional synthesis process
1d\_synthesis() applied either to rows or columns of the matrix A[][].

1d\_synthesis() applies filtering to a one dimensional array C[] of
coefficients.

Where 1d\_synthesis() is applied to a row of data, then a value C[k]
shall be identified with a value A[j][k] where j is the index of the row
being processed.

Where 1d\_synthesis() is applied to a column of data, then a value C[k]
shall be identified with a value A[k][i] where i is the index of the
column being processed.

The one-dimensional synthesis process comprises the application of a
number of reversible integer lifting filter operations lift1() to
liftN().

The number of lifting operations and their definition depends upon the
choice of wavelet filter derived from the WAVELET\_FILTER\_INDEX value
defined for the frame data unit. The definition of lifting and of
lifting operations for particular wavelet filters are given in
subsequent sections.
