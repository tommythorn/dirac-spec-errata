TV transfer characteristic

Denoting R or G or B as “L” (light) and ER, EG, EB as
“E” then E=f(L) such is that;



All modern TV systems use this transfer characteristic at present. ITU-R
BT 470 (Conventional Television systems PAL, NTSC and SECAM) specifies
an “assumed gamma value of the receiver for which the primary
signals are pre-corrected” as 2.2 for NTSC and 2.8 for PAL. This
specification is incomplete, incorrect and obsolete and modern PAL and
NTSC systems use the “TV” transfer characteristic above.


Extended Colour Gamut

ITU-R BT 1361, Worldwide unified colorimetry of future TV systems
defines a transfer characteristic for systems with an extended colour
gamut as follows.

Denoting R or G or B as “L” (light) and ER, EG, EB as
“E” then E=f(L) such that;



This transfer characteristic is intended to be used with systems using
an extended colour gamut.

Linear

A linear transfer characteristic has f(x)=x.
