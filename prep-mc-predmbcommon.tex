This section specifies the function decode\_mb\_split(x,y) for a
macroblock at coordinates (x,y).

MB\_COMMON is decoded differentially with respect to a prediction. The
reconstruction procedure is 

MB\_COMMON(x,y)=binary\_arith\_decode()+mb\_split\_prediction(x,y) ( mod 2 )

The MB\_COMMON prediction residue is encoded in the bitstream as a single
binary bit, with context MB\_COMMON\_CTX.

The prediction function mb\_common\_prediction(x,y) is defined as the mean
of available previously-decoded predictors in the prediction arrangement
defined in Section :

if (x>0 \&\& y>0 )

    mb\_common\_prediction(x,y)=( MB\_COMMON (x-1,y)+MB\_COMMON(x-1,y-1)+
                                                        MB\_COMMON(x,y-1)
)/3

It returns a value 0 or 1.
