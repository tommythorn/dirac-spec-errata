\label{mc:scale}
When motion compensating chrominance components of the picture, some
scaling of parameters is required when the chroma components
do not have the same dimensions as the luminance component in order to
take into account different chroma sampling formats.

The horizontal and vertical scaling factors are:

\begin{align*}
\text{\texttt{chroma\_h\_scale}} =
  \begin{cases}
    1 &\text{when Cr4:4:4},\\
    2 &\text{when Cr4:2:2},\\
    2 &\text{when Cr4:2:0}
  \end{cases}
&\qquad
\text{\texttt{chroma\_v\_scale}} =
  \begin{cases}
    1 &\text{when Cr4:4:4},\\
    1 &\text{when Cr4:2:2},\\
    2 &\text{when Cr4:2:0}
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}

The scaling of parameters is then:
\begin{itemize}
\item Each block is reduced in size horizontally and vertically by
factors of \texttt{chroma\_h\_scale} and \texttt{chroma\_v\_scale}.

\item Each block motion vector is reduced in magnitude horizontally
and vertically by factors of \texttt{chroma\_h\_scale} and
\texttt{chroma\_v\_scale}.

\end{itemize}
