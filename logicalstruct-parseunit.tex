Seekable constructs within the bitstream are called parse units.  Parse
units start with a synchronisation word, type identifier and pointers to
the start of the next/previous parse unit.

Synchronisation words allow for easy stream synchronisation.

There is no deliberate attempt to prevent the arithmetic coding of data
in the bytestream from containing accidental repetitions of the
synchronisation word. A decoder should check that the next/previous
pointers in the parse unit point to a valid synchronisation word,
especially on start up.

There are only two types of seekable construct within the bitstream:
Access Unit Headers and Frames.

No synchronisation words are used within a video frame to regain
synchronisation.
