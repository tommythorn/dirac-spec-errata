Data is encoded in the Dirac bitstream in a number of ways. These split
into two sorts: fixed-length and variable length. The syntax and
decoding semantics for these formats are described in the succeeding
sections.

These sections describe how bit sequences shall be interpreted as values
of various types. For the purposes of this section, a bit sequences are
numbered arrays of bits which are represented graphically with the first
bit in the leftmost position:

\begin{verbatim}
b[0] b[1] b[2] ...
\end{verbatim}

This order is the order that bits are extracted from the bitstream in
accordance with the bit packing convention (Section ).
