The interpretation of Display Parameters by a display mechanism
interfacing with a compliant decoder is non-normative. However, it
should where possible follow the recommendations and interpretations
specified in this section. Likewise, encoders should ensure that
accurate display parameter information is encoded to maximise the
quality of displayed video.
