This section specifies the operation of decode\_MB\_block\_data(x,y). This
process is invoked in the decoding of each MB.

Block motion data consists of decoding the prediction mode and motion
vectors for all the prediction units in the MB. The process depends upon
the values of MB\_SPLIT and MB\_COMMON. The decoding process is as
follows: scan the prediction units within a macroblock in raster order
and for each prediction unit:

1. If MB\_COMMON is TRUE, decode a mode PRED\_MODE for the top-left
prediction unit in the macroblock as per Section . This mode shall also
be used for all prediction units in the MB. 

2. Loop over all the prediction units in the macroblock in raster order,
and for each prediction unit:

a) If MB\_COMMON is FALSE decode a mode to be used for the prediction
unit as per Section  and set as PRED\_MODE

b) If  PRED\_MODE is REF1ONLY or REF1AND2 decode a motion vector MV1 as
per Section 

c) If  PRED\_MODE is REF2ONLY or REF1AND2 decode a motion vector MV2 as
per Section 

d) If PRED\_MODE is INTRA, decode DC values PU\_DC\_Y, PU\_DC\_C1 and
PU\_DC\_C2 as per Section 



\begin{informative}
The identification of the PRED\_MODE value for the macroblock with that
for the top-left prediction unit is so that the prediction aperture
defined in Section  can be consistently applied.
