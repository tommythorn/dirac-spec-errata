Unsigned unary data represents unsigned integer values. The value
$n \geq 0$ is represented as $n$ zeroes followed by a 1:

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
Value & Binarisation\\
\hline\\
0  & 1 \\
1  & 01 \\
\dots & \dots\\
$n$   & $\underbrace{0\dots0}_n 1$
\end{tabular}

The bit values in the unary representation of a value are referred to by
bin numbers: the first bit lies in bin 1, the second in bin 2 and so on.
A 0 in bin $n$ therefore indicates that the value is greater than or equal
to $n$, where a 1 indicates the value equals $n-1$.
