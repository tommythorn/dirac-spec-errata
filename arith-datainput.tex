The arithmetic decoding process accesses data in a contiguous block of
length LENGTH bytes in the bitstream (LENGTH=MV\_DATA\_LENGTH or
SUBBAND\_DATA\_LENGTH depending on whether motion data or subband
coefficient data is being decoded).

A function input\_bit() is defined such that: if less than LENGTH full
bytes of data have been input into the arithmetic decoding process,
input\_bit() shall return the next bit in bitstream order according to
the conventions of Section ; otherwise 0 shall be returned.

When decoding some implementations may require more than LENGTH bytes of
data input in order to stabilise and decode the last values.
