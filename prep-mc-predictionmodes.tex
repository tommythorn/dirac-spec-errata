Four prediction modes shall be supported by the decoder:

INTRA

REF1ONLY

REF2ONLY

REF1AND2.

These correspond to using DC prediction, using a motion compensated
prediction from Reference 1 only, using a motion compensated prediction
from Reference 2 and using a motion compensated prediction composed from
data from both Reference 1 and Reference 2.

The prediction modes shall be identified with two-bit words as follows: 

INTRA=b00

REF1ONLY=b01

REF2ONLY=b10

REF1AND2=b11

In this way, Reference 1 is used for prediction if and only if
(PRED\_MODE\&b01) and  Reference 2 is used for prediction if and only if
(PRED\_MODE\&b10).
