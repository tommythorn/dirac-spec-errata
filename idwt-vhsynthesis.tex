This section specifies the operation of the vertical and horizontal
synthesis process vh\_synthesis().

vh\_synthesis( LL , HL , LH , HH ) is repeatedly invoked by
iwt\_synthesis(). It operates on four subbands labelled LL, HL, LH and HH
to produce a new subband SYNTH\_BAND, which is returned as the result of
the process. The subbands LL, HL, LH and HH shall all have identical
dimensions.

First, the data from the four subbands are interleaved to form a single
two-dimensional array A[][] whose vertical and horizontal dimensions are
twice that of each of the original subbands, using the interleave()
process specified in Section :

A=interleave( LL , HL, LH , HH )

Vertical synthesis is performed second. For each column of coefficients
in the array A[][], the 1d\_synthesis() procedure is applied.

Horizontal synthesis is performed third. For each row of coefficients in
the array A[][], the 1d\_synthesis procedure is applied.

The new subband SYNTH\_BAND comprises the data in the processed 2D array
A[][].
