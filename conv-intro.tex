In this specification we have adopted three specific processes to define
what we mean.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The structure of the system is described in a series of parse
    diagrams, which are represented pictorially.

    \item When reading the data from the bytestream, the receiver
    follows the process identified by the parse diagrams to allocate the
    data to the appropriate variables in the receiver's memory. The
    variables are described in a pseudocode, which is loosely based on
    the Python programming language.

	\item The path through the tree, is again described in the pseudocode.
\end{itemize}

This section provides the necessary information for understanding the
normative specification.
