This section describes the operation of the decode\_coeff(x,y) process
for a coefficient in position (x,y), within a code block in position
(i,j).

A value magnitude is decoded by the recipe

SUBBAND[y][x]=uu\_arith\_decode()

The magnitude is then scaled by:

SUBBAND[y][x] *= QF[j][i]

If SUBBAND[y][x] is not zero, an offset is added:

SUBBAND[y][x] += OFFSET[j][i]

If SUBBAND[y][x]>0, then a sign value is decoded

SIGN=binary\_arith\_decode()

and if SIGN is FALSE

SUBBAND[y][x] = -SUBBAND[y][x]

If the frame is an INTRA frame and the subband is the DC band, then the
coefficient is modified by a prediction:

SUBBAND[y][x] += intra\_dc\_prediction(x,y)

The operation of intra\_dc\_prediction() is defined in Section . 

The derivation of contexts for use in magnitude and sign decoding is
defined in Sections  and .

After the coefficient has been decoded, then the count of coefficients
is updated:

COUNT++

if (COUNT>== RESET\_COUNT\_RESET)

{

    COUNT=0

    halve\_all\_counts()

}
