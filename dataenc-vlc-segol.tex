Signed exp-Golomb data is decoded to produce signed integer values. It
consists of a uegol-coded unsigned value followed by a sign symbol, if
the unsigned value is non-zero. The decoding procedure is:

1. Decode an unsigned value value using the uegol(n) decoding procedure.
Set as VALUE.

2. Then
\begin{verbatim}
if ( VALUE )
{
    if ( !read\_bits( 1 ) )
        VALUE = -VALUE
}
\end{verbatim}
