This section specifies the function decode\_mb\_using\_global(x,y) for a
macroblock at coordinates (x,y).

MB\_USING\_GLOBAL is decoded differentially with respect to a prediction.
The reconstruction procedure is 

MB\_USING\_GLOBAL(x,y)=binary\_arith\_decode()+mb\_using\_global\_prediction(x,y)
( mod 2 )

A single context is used: MB\_USING\_GLOBAL\_CTX.

The prediction function mb\_using\_global\_prediction(x,y) is defined as
the mean of available previously-decoded predictors in the prediction
arrangement defined in Section:

if (x>0 \&\& y>0 )

    mb\_using\_global\_prediction(x,y)=( MB\_USING\_GLOBAL (x-1,y)+
                                                              MB\_USING\_GLOBAL (x-1,y-1)+
                                                              MB\_USING\_GLOBAL (x,y-1) )/3

It returns a value 0 or 1.
