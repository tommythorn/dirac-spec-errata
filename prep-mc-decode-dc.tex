This section specifies the decoding process for a DC value PU\_DC in a
prediction unit whose top-left block has coordinates (x,y).

DC values are decoded differentially with respect to a prediction. The
decoding process is

PU\_DC\_Y = dc\_pred()+su\_arith\_decode()

If CHROMA\_FORMAT is not YONLY then the chroma DC values are also
decoded:

PU\_DC\_C1 = dc\_pred()+su\_arith\_decode()

PU\_DC\_C2 = dc\_pred()+su\_arith\_decode()

Different contexts are used depending upon the binarisation bins and
component as per

Prediction 

The prediction process dc\_pred() predicts component DC values for a
prediction unit as the unbiased mean of available DC values for the
corresponding component from prediction units in the prediction
aperture. The prediction aperture is as specified in Section .

DC values in a prediction unit are available if PRED\_MODE is INTRA.
