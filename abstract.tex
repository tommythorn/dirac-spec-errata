This document is the specification of the Dirac video decoder and stream syntax.

Dirac is a video compression system utilising wavelet transforms and motion
compensation. It is designed to be simple, flexible, yet highly effective. 
It can operate across a wide range of resolutions and
application domains, including: internet and mobile streaming, delivery of 
standard-definition and high-definition
television, digital television and cinema production and distribution,
and low-power devices and embedded applications.

The system offers several key features:
\begin{itemize}
\item lossy and lossless coding using a common tool set
\item intra-coded modes for professional production applications
\item a special low delay mode for link adaption applications, such as the carriage of HDTV
over SDTV infrastructure
 \item motion-compensated (`long-GOP') modes for distribution applications
\item gradual quality reduction with increasing compression 
\end{itemize}
