This document is the specification of the Dirac video decoder and stream syntax.

Dirac is a video compression system utilising wavelet transforms and motion
compensation. It is designed to be simple, flexible, yet highly effective. 
It can operate across a wide range of resolutions and
application domains, including: internet and mobile streaming, delivery of 
standard-definition and high-definition
television, digital television and cinema production and distribution,
and low-power devices and embedded applications.

The system offers several key features:
\begin{itemize}
  \item lossy and lossless coding using a common tool set
    \item low-complexity and low-delay modes for hi bit rate professional production applications
  \item motion-compensated (`long-GOP') modes for distribution applications
	\item gradual quality loss with increasing compression 
\end{itemize}
