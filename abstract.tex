This document is the specification of the Dirac video decoder and stream syntax.

Dirac is based on motion-compensated wavelet compression, and is designed to be
simple and flexible and yet highly effective. It can operate across a wide range
 of resolutions and
application domains, including: internet and mobile streaming, delivery of 
standard-definition and high-definition
television, digital television and cinema production and distribution,
and low-power devices and embedded applications.

The system offers several key features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item highly flexible lossy and lossless coding using a common tool set
	\item both intra-frame and motion-prediction coding
	\item gradual quality loss with increasing compression 
\end{itemize}
