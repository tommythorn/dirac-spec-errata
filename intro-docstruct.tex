This document seeks to provide a wide range of information about Dirac.

XXX This document needs reordering!

Section \ref{outline} provides an overview of the algorithms used. This
is intended to give an outline of video compression techniques, and
describes Dirac as a simple evolution of the art, enabled by technology
advances.

Section \ref{conventions} gives an introduction to the conventions used
in the rest of the document. Sometimes we need to be clear about the
meanings of our words.

Section \ref{bytestream} gives a description of the Bytestream

Section \ref{arith-coding} explains how to unpack the
arithmetically-coded data.
XXX Why is this here???

Sections \ref{idwt-1} and \ref{idwt-2} give details about how to derive
the wavelet coefficients.

Sections \ref{mc-1} and \ref{mc-2} give details about how to use the
motion vectors together with the restored wavelet coefficients to give
the restored video sequence.

Finally, the appendices contain tables of standard settings, guidance on
the options available in the coder and other useful data.
