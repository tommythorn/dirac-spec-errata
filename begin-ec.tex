Transmission of the raw motion vectors and wavelet coefficients is
inefficient. There are still many redundancies in the data, and the form
of the data is itself suboptimum.

Coding of the motion vectors is especially important for codecs with a
high level of motion accuracy (quarter or eighth pixel say). Motion
vector coding and decoding is quite complicated, since significant gains
in efficiency can be made by choosing a good prediction and entropy
coding structure.

The processes of removing the redundancies is probably one of the most
complicated part of the codec. Similar processes are used for coding the
motion vectors and the wavelet coefficients. In various ways they use a
combination of

\begin{itemize}
	\item prediction,
	\item binarisation,
	\item context modelling and
	\item adaptive arithmetic coding.
\end{itemize}
