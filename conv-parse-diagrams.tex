Hierarchical bitstream elements are defined in terms of their component
data elements, which are presented as block parse diagrams.  A
blockparse diagram of the form

XX Include diagram here

specifies that Data Element 1 is always followed in the bitstream by
Data Element 2.

A blockparse diagram of the form

XX Include diagram here

specifies that one or more data elements of type Data Element 2 always
follow Data Element 1. The Data Element 2 elements may be different,
i.e. may be differently instantiated according to their own
specification.

A blockparse diagram of the form

XX Include diagram here

specifies that Data Element 2 conditionally follows Data Element 1.
Whether or not it does will depend on previously derived decoder
variable values (not necessarily always contained in Data Element 1).
