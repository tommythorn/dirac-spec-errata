For the purposes of this specification a subband SUBBAND will be
identified with a two dimensional data array of coefficients SUBBAND[][]
where the first index ranges from 0 to SUBBAND\_HEIGHT-1 and the second
index from 0 to SUBBAND\_WIDTH-1, so that

SUBBAND[y][x]

represents the xth coefficient on row y.

Parents and children

If SUBBAND\_NUM<NUM\_SUBBANDS-3 then the subband has a parent subband. The
index of the parent subband is given by SUBBAND\_NUM+3.

If a subband has a parent subband then each coefficient has a parent
coefficient. The coordinates of the parent coefficient to a coefficient
at coordinates (x,y) are (x>>1,y>>1) in the parent subband. A parent
coefficient therefore has four children (). Parent subbands and their
coefficients occur earlier in the bitstream than their children.

Orientation

All subbands other than the DC subband have an associated orientation.
If SUBBAND\_NUM mod 3=1 then the subband is vertically oriented. If
SUBBAND\_NUM mod 3=2 then the subband is horizontally oriented. If
SUBBAND\_NUM mod 3=0 then the subband is diagonally oriented.
