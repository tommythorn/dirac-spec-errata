This section specifies the function decode\_mb\_split(x,y) for a
macroblock at coordinates (x,y).

MB\_SPLIT is decoded differentially with respect to a prediction. The
MB\_SPLIT prediction residue is encoded in the bitstream using truncated
unary binarisation, since the values are constrained to lie in the range
0-2. The reconstruction procedure is therefore

MB\_SPLIT(x,y)=ut\_arith\_decode()+mb\_split\_prediction(x,y) ( mod 3 )

Two contexts are used for bin 1 and bin 2: MB\_SPLIT\_CTX\_BIN1 and
MB\_SPLIT\_CTX\_BIN2.

The prediction function mb\_split\_prediction(x,y) is defined as the mean
of available previously-decoded MB\_SPLIT values in the neighbouring
predictor macroblocks, as per Section :

if (x>0 \&\& y>0 )

    mb\_split\_prediction(x,y)=( MB\_SPLIT(x-1,y)+ MB\_SPLIT(x-1,y-1)+
MB\_SPLIT(x,y-1) )/3

 It returns a value 0,1 or 2.
