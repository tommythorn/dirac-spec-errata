Often, we find that the motion vectors required to match a pixel in a
reference frame to the predicted frame are not integer values.

In Dirac, we can specify motion vectors to 1/8 pixel accuracy.

This means that the coder and decoder have to carry out a process that
is effectively an upconversion of the signal.
