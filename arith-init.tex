At the beginning of the decoding of any data unit, the arithmetic
decoding state is initialised as follows:

Initialise Arithmetic Decoding Engine
\begin{verbatim}
initialise_arithmetic_decoding(block_data_length):
    #Arithmetic decoding is specified
        using global variables
    bytes_left = block_data_length
    #Arithmetic coded data is byte aligned
        so set zero "bits_left"
    bits_left = 0
    low = 0x0000
    high = 0x0000
    code = 0x0000
\end{verbatim}
