This section describes the arithmetic decoding engine and
processes for using it to extract data from the Dirac stream.

The arithmetic decoding engine consists of three elements: 

\begin{itemize}
\item a global state
structure variable  \ArithState representing the state of the arithmetic 
decoder (Section \ref{initarith})
\item a set of functions for extracting values from the decoder 
and updating the decoder state (Section \ref{extractarith})
\end{itemize}
