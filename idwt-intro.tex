This section defines the process iwt() for reconstructing component data
from decoded subbands using the Inverse Wavelet Transform (IWT). iwt()
is invoked in decoding Transform Data units which encapsulate component
data, if and only if ZERO\_COEFFS is FALSE.

The iwt() process consists of two sub-processes:

1. iwt\_synthesis()

2. iwt\_pad\_removal()

The output of this process is a two-dimensional array DATA[][] of pixel
data representing Y, U or V component data.
