This section specifies the interleaving process interleave( LL , HL , LH
, HH ) by which the data elements belonging to four subband data arrays
are combined into a single data array A. The elements of A are defined
by:

A[2*j][2*i] = LL[j][i]

A[2*j][2*i+1] = HL[j][i]

A[2*j+1][2*i] = LH[j][i]

A[2*j+1][2*i+1] = HH[j][i]

for all $i$ such that $0 \leq i < width(LL)$ and all $j$ such that
$0 \leq j < height(LL)$.

\begin{informative}
Note that the interleaving process always creates an array with even
dimensions.
